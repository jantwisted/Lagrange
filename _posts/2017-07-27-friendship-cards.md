## THOUGH WE MAY BE MILES APART, WE'RE ALWAYS UNDER THE SAME SKY!

It's always nice to have long distance friends, and why not getting a postcard. In 2014, I officially started to travel around the world and I was able to meet good people who remain as friends from miles away. As I don't believe much in social networking, even though it sounds cool and efficient, I have decided to write them in snail mail.
